Letâ€™s suppose we need to search across 100s of documents (search for words). 
One way to do it is to go one file at a time. But that will take too long. 
So write a multi-threaded or multi-process program to run the search across 
100s of files. Keep the number of threads/processes configurable. 

Output - files which have the word being searched.

Solution :

I created the linear as well as parallel solution for finding content.

Input- 

number of files created (N) [1 >= i <= Integer.MAX_VALUE]
search content (str) [format : file*content*] * represent number i
number of threads (threads_count) [1 >= i <= Integer.MAX_VALUE]
