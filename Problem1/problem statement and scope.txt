Design database schema for Instagram

solution :-

Consideration:

The instagram that I design has functionally
1. Personal Account (Not business)
2. Users can do posts, Add stories, chat with other members, and create reels.
3. Report option is also present.

User Table
- userId is main key for any perticular User.
- passowrd is hashed and stored in database.

User profile
- profile picture : stored on file system and name of file is stored on db


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note ->

The chats and comments are the documents realated data. So it can be best fitted 
on noSQL datbases.
e.g. "comments" = { "post_id" :[{"user_id": "", "content":"", "dateTime": ""}, ...]}
